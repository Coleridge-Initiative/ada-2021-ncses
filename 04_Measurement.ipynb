    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The information available in datasets don't just arise naturally. They are collected through various different means, and these processes can have implications on the types of conclusions you can make. For example, the SED and SDR are surveys, and the SDR involves a complex sampling design and requires the use of survey weights. The UMETRICS data are built using administrative records of grants provided by IRIS-member universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the possible implications of this? For one, the SED directly measures funding by asking whether the respondent received grant funding during their time in graduate school. However, this is a very high-level measure, and the more fine-grained information about sources of funding and consistency of funding are missing. For example, there is nothing on the SED that asks about federal funding. In addition, there are a few possible sources of error. The respondent may not remember exactly when and how much funding they had or they may have misunderstood the question. The UMETRICS data avoid these issues of measurement, but there are possible sources of error and missingness there as well. Not all universities participate in IRIS, and so only a subset of the universities are present in UMETRICS data. Bringing in the UMETRICS data to use with the SED means that the datasets must be linked, which comes with linkage errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the SED and SDR questions were designed for research purposes, the UMETRICS data was not generated with research in mind. When using administrative data like UMETRICS for research, you have to thoughtfully construct measures from the data that is provided. In this notebook, you will explore the linked SED-UMETRICS data to get a better sense of how these two data sources might be used together and to think critically about what exactly is being measured and how missingness in the data should be interpreted. \n",
