We also created a table that provided us with counts associated with each source of funding over time â€“ here, time was defined in terms of semesters. For your research project, you may be interested in learning about the distribution of other sources of funding or even variables over time. In this sub-section, we explore this idea by taking into account the top 3 sources of funding. When looking at time as a variable, it is encouraged to utilize a line (`geom_line` in R) plot as it allows for effective interpretation. \n",
