# Applied Data Anaytics Program at National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), National Science Foundation (NSF)

The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES) hosted the Fall 2021 Coleridge Initiative Applied Data Analytics training program.

Participants work in teams to define and complete a project related to career pathways for doctoral recipients. The program provides up-to-date perspectives on the use of administrative and survey data for policy analysis, and instruction on how to manage and analyze micro data according to best practices. Instructors facilitate hands-on coding of micro data in SQL and R for the following tasks: data management, text analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.

This repository contains the class materials for the NCSES applied data analytics program.
